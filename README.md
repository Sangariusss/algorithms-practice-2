# RSA Algorithm Implementation

## Practical Work #2: RSA Algorithm

### Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, which is an asymmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission.

### Tasks
1. **Implementation:**
   - Develop an RSA encryption algorithm using any algorithmic programming language.
   - Utilize functions implemented in the previous practical work.

### Implementation Requirements
1. **Handling Large Numbers:**
   - Implement the algorithm to handle large numbers effectively.

2. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Test the program with large numbers and specify the maximum range of possible numbers.
   - Verify the correctness of the results with external calculations.

3. **Efficiency Evaluation:**
   - Assess the program's efficiency in terms of time complexity, number of operations, Big-O notation, and memory usage.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the implementation file using your chosen algorithmic programming language.
3. Execute the program, providing necessary inputs for testing.

### Evaluation and Conclusion
Provide insights and conclusions based on the following criteria:
- Handling large numbers effectively.
- Correctness of results, especially with external verification.
- Efficiency metrics, including time complexity, number of operations, and memory usage.
